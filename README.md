## Ecommerce Data Analysis and Dashboard Creation :

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process I followed to create the Power BI dashboard.

#### Step 1 : Downloaded the Dataset
- Acquired the ecommerce dataset from Kaggle to use as the foundation for analysis.

#### Step 2 : Loaded Data into Jupyter Notebook
- Imported the dataset into Jupyter Notebook for initial exploration and processing.

#### Step 3 : Created Dimensional Tables
- Designed and generated dimensional tables to organize the data for easier analysis.
#### Step 4 : Cleaned and Analyzed the Data
- Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, formatting columns, and preparing the data for insights.
- Performed exploratory data analysis to identify trends, correlations, and key metrics.
#### Step 5 : Exported the Analysis Dataset
- Saved the cleaned and analyzed dataset to be loaded into Power BI for visualization.
#### Step 6 : Built the Sales Trends Dashboard
